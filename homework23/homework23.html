                Whether it's the summer grass that tickles your feet or the red Bordeaux smacking on your palate,
                nearly every part of the world around you carries special chemical markers. These markers, called
                isotopes,
                can tell scientists where the molecules that compose a substance are from, where they traveled and what
                happened
                to them along the way.
                But doing these analyses has been complex and costly. Now, Stanford chemists have developed a new method
                to
                make
                isotopic analysis easier and less expensive.

                BY CYNTHIA HAVEN L.A. Cicero Lindy Hop instruction Stanford is an epicenter for the vintage dance
                movementâ€”but
                life in the Stanford dance world is not all foxtrots and tangos.
                The June 26-28 Stanford's Dance Weekend in Roble Gym offers something for modern dance enthusiasts, too:
                the
                hustle, the West Coast swing, 1970s disco hustle, Bollywood and blues fusion.
