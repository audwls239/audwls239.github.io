        I am a lecturer in the Stanford Computer Science Department. Before coming to Stanford. I spent two years as a
        programmer at Taligent (now part of IBM). At Taligent, I worked on Places for Project Teams, a groupware product
        designed to improve communication and coordination within small project teams. I was fortunate to work with the
        Places for Project Teams product throughout an entire software lifecycle from initial product conception through
        the actual product launch.
